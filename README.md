# Political Party Affiliation Dataset

Web application built using R and Shiny.

I cleaned some data taken from the GSS used to predict political party affiliation using logistic regression

More Information about the GSS can be found [here](http://gss.norc.org/)

[The web app is hosted at www.shinnyapps.io and can be found here](https://dylanjm.shinyapps.io/predicting_politics/)

A slide show detailing the logistic regression and how I came the conclussion can be found on the web app.
